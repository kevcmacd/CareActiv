# Patient Care Management Application

- Start by installing WampServer from http://www.wampserver.com/en/

- Once it is installed make sure the icon on your system tray is green. If it is not left click on it and click start all services. If it still isnt green you may need to do some troubleshooting. 
(Most problems come from other programs using the same port as the wampserver. You can check if something is using this port by left clicking the wamp icon then going to "Apache" then "Services" and they clicking on test port 80. Once Wamp is the only thing using the port it should work. If not or if it states that nothing is using this port you may need to click install service from the same menu as the test port 80)

- Once the wamp icon is green you can unzip the program's folder into the www directory inside of the wamp folder.

- Install MySQL Workbench from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/ and run the mysql_db_script.sql script and start the mySQL server. It should display that it is running and everything is ok.

- Once it is unzipped into the www folder and the wamp icon is green you can go to your internet browser (Tested only on Google Chrome browser.) and go to the address localhost/WHI/index.html (Keep in mind that this only works if you dont change any of the folder names. If you do you need to make the same changes in the address name.)
